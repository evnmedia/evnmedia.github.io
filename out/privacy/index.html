class="text-muted-foreground">Last updated January 25, 2023</p><p>This privacy notice for EVN LTD (&#x27;Company&#x27;, &#x27;we&#x27;, &#x27;us&#x27;, or &#x27;our&#x27;), describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and/or share (&quot;process&quot;) your information when you use our services (&#x27;Services&#x27;), such as when you:</p><ul><li>Visit our website at evnmedia.com, or any website of ours that links to this privacy notice</li><li>Engage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or events</li></ul><p><strong>Questions or concerns?</strong> Reading this privacy notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. If you still have any questions or concerns, please contact us at: team@evnmedia.com</p><h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2><h3>Personal information you disclose to us:</h3><p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p><p><strong>Personal Information Provided by You:</strong> The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:</p><ul><li>names</li><li>phone numbers</li><li>email addresses</li><li>contact preferences</li><li>contact or authentication data</li><li>billing addresses</li><li>debit/credit card numbers</li><li>usernames</li><li>passwords</li><li>job titles</li><li>mailing addresses</li></ul><p><strong>Sensitive Information:</strong> We do not process sensitive information.</p><p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p><h3>Information automatically collected:</h3><p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p><p>The information we collect includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Log and Usage Data.</strong> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called &#x27;crash dumps&#x27;), and hardware settings).</li><li><strong>Device Data.</strong> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</li><li><strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as information about your device&#x27;s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li></ul><h2>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2><p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</p><ul><li>To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user</li><li>To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users</li><li>To send administrative information to you. We may process your information to send you details about our products and services, changes to our terms and policies, and other similar information</li><li>To fulfil and manage your orders</li><li>To enable user-to-user communications</li><li>To request feedback</li><li>To send you marketing and promotional communications</li><li>To deliver targeted advertising to you</li><li>To protect our Services</li><li>To identify usage trends</li><li>To determine the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional campaigns</li><li>To save or protect an individual&#x27;s vital interest</li></ul><h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2><p>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</p><p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you:</strong></p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p><ul><li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li><li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li><li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:<ul><li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li><li>Develop and display personalised and relevant advertising content for our users</li><li>Analyse how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li><li>Support our marketing activities</li><li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li><li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li></ul></li><li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li><li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li></ul><p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you:</strong></p><p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p><p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p><ul><li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li><li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li><li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li><li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li><li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li><li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li><li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li><li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li><li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li><li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li><li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li></ul><h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2><p>We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents (&#x27;third parties&#x27;) who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p><ul><li>Data Analytics Services</li><li>Data Storage Service Providers</li><li>Finance &amp; Accounting Tools</li><li>Payment Processors</li><li>Performance Monitoring Tools</li></ul><p>We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p><ul><li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li><li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honour this privacy notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.</li><li><strong>Business Partners.</strong> We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions.</li></ul><h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2><p>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p><p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p><p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p><h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2><p>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p><p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p><h2>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2><p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent&#x27;s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at: team@evnmedia.com</p><h2>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2><p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in Section 12 of this policy.</p><p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p><p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.</p><p>If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.</p><p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in Section 12 of this policy.</p><p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p><p><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in Section 12 of this policy. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you – for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p><p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at: team@evnmedia.com</p><h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2><p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (DNT) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p><h2>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2><p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the &#x27;Shine The Light&#x27; law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
